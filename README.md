## Structure
### Website pages
I have structured the website with clear, concise structure, information and purpose. I use the Bootstrap grid system throughout, which gave a consistent structure and responsive design "out of the box"
1. Home/Landing Page: This is the first page the user encounters when they access the site, before they log in/register. They have the ability to open the travel posts however cannot interact with the post.
2. Register: This page allows the user to register an account to interact with all posts.
3. Login: This page allows the user to login to the site.
4. Add Post: This page allows the user to add a travel post.
5. Edit Post: This page allows a user to edit a travel post they have created.
6. Delete Post: This button allows a user to delete a travel post they have created.
7. Logout: This link allows the user to logout of the site.
8. 404: The 404 error page is displayed if the user enters an incorrect url when accessing the site.
